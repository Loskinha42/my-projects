# my-projects

## 📌 Objective

This repository is where I’ll build and store the code for all my personal projects as I learn programming.  
My goal is to **grow** through consistent practice and real-world challenges.

### 🎯 My goals:
- Learn programming through hands-on practice  
- Gradually increase the complexity of my projects over time  
- Become not just a good coder, but a **rare, high-level professional**  
- Stay motivated and passionate about IT — I don't want to be average  

---

🚀 I'm just getting started, but this repository will reflect my growth, step by step.  
✝️ Christ lives.
